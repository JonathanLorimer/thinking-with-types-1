\chapter{Injectivity}

Injectivity is a property of functions, such that for any output $y$, there is
exactly one input $x$ such that $f(x) = y$. While this is an interesting
mathematical phenomenon in and of itself, for us it means that our function is
reversible. Knowing the result is just as good as knowing the inputs.

Though injectivity can exist at the term-level, for our purposes we are
interested more in its manifestation at the type-level.

Let's first think about \ty{Maybe a}. \ty{Maybe} is an injective function---its'
kind is \kind{Type -> Type}. Because we can infer \ty{a}
